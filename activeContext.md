# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Integrating enhanced Mermaid diagram interaction and implementing download task functionality in `visual-overview.html`.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created `visual-overview.html` to display the interactive Mermaid diagram.
- Integrated the code from `interactive-project-overview.html` into `visual-overview.html`.
- Converted Node.js file monitor to use ES Modules for better maintainability and modern JavaScript features.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement automatic updates to the memory bank and visual overview.
- Implement automatic red task marking.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- Determining the best way to track failed attempts for automatic red task marking.
- Deciding how to handle file uploads and updates to the memory bank.
- Implementing loop detection, task plan review, and backup mechanisms.
- Corrected cli.js file using write_to_file tool.

**Current Status:**
I have been unable to correct the syntax errors in `sample-dashboard.html` and implement the task counts and filtering functionality. I have attempted multiple times, but I am still encountering issues. I have added a rule to `.clinerules` to prevent looping behavior.

**Next Steps:**
Request assistance from another AI to resolve the syntax errors and implement the task counts and filtering functionality in `sample-dashboard.html`.
