Okay, here is a comprehensive project plan incorporating the architecture, task hierarchy, prompt structure, and tracking mechanisms outlined in the provided documents.   

This plan integrates the Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA), the SPARC framework (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion), Boomerang Task delegation, and TaskMaster orchestration concepts  with the specific tasks outlined in the "Consolidated Project Plan".   

Core Concepts:

Vertical Slices: Each "Phase" from the Consolidated Project Plan will be treated as a Vertical Slice, representing a distinct feature or capability of the AI Project Planner.   
TaskMaster: An overarching orchestrator initiates slices (Phases) and manages the delegation and results aggregation of Boomerang Tasks.   
Boomerang Tasks: Used to delegate specific sub-tasks or micro-tasks to an AI agent, which operates in an isolated context and returns results.   
SPARC: While not explicitly listed as tasks below, the SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) guide the overall development within each slice and task.   
Tracking: A file monitor watches a designated 'task_updates.log' file. Upon task completion, the assigned AI agent appends a structured log entry. The monitor parses this log to update a central dashboard or database, marking tasks as 'Complete', 'Requires Review', etc.   
Project Plan Structure:

Each Phase (Vertical Slice) includes Tasks, Sub-tasks, and potentially Micro-tasks. For each, a sample prompt structure is provided.

Phase 1: Core Architecture (Vertical Slice)    

Objective: Basic task structure with file-aware token calculation.   

Success Criteria: Functional web interface with manual task management.   

Orchestration: TaskMaster initiates Phase 1 tasks.

(Note: The "Consolidated Project Plan" provides less detail for Phase 5 tasks beyond P5 itself. Further sub-tasks like branch management specific to AI changes, PR creation helpers, etc., would need to be defined based on the SPARC Specification phase for this slice).   

Task Update File & Monitor (task_updates.log):

Format: Each line is a JSON object representing a completed task update.
JSON

{ "task_id": "P1.1.1", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "Claude-3-Opus", "timestamp": "2025-04-01T14:30:00Z", "output_files": ["task_ui.html", "task_ui.css", "task_ui.js"] }
{ "task_id": "P1.2.1", "status": "Requires Review", "model_name": "Gemini-1.5-Pro", "timestamp": "2025-04-01T14:35:10Z", "output_files": ["file_monitor.js"], "notes": "Needs testing for large file sets." }
Monitor: The File Monitor service (P1.2.1) watches this file. On new entries, it parses the JSON and updates the central project status (potentially in a database or reflected directly in the UI/Dashboard 2.0). This allows for real-time tracking of task completions and statuses.   
This detailed plan provides the structure, tasks, and example prompts necessary to guide AI agents in executing the project, ensuring outputs are tracked and aligned with the defined architecture.

Your uploads may be too large for the best results. Learn more
I'm getting a note that my uploads may be too large for the best results. This is exactly why we need complete yet concise task outlines. For example, instead of the ai given the task needing to consume the files above, the content being referenced should be in the prompt (eg color scheme etc.) Also, we want to avoid zip files. We don't want to unzip thing and deal with all that just to have backup iterations of a task. Instead, we should make a backup of a file with the task name and time so it's easy to revert to a past file if required, or give a past code file directly to the llm making an iteration on that file. Most online playgrounds allow you to attach text files. Some allow you to attach code files. Many just want you to type (or paste) the task into the chat window.




Show thinking
Okay, I understand the need for more concise prompts and a different backup strategy to better suit LLM workflows and constraints. Let's refine the plan:

Core Principle Adjustments:

Context in Prompts: Prompts will now directly include necessary context (like specific code snippets, configuration values, or requirements) instead of just referencing large documents. For code modifications, prompts will reference specific, versioned files (see below) or include the relevant code block directly.
File-Based Versioning (No ZIPs): The backup system (P2.3) will now create versioned copies of files before they are modified for a task. The format will be [original_filename]_[task_id]_[timestamp].[ext] (e.g., task_ui.css_P1.1.2_20250401144500.css). This allows for easy rollback or providing specific previous versions to the AI for iteration. The 7-day retention policy applies to these individual versioned files. Task P2.2.2 (Rollback) will utilize these versioned files.
Flexible Task Packaging (Text/Markdown): The export system (P3) will focus on generating plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) files containing the task brief, AI context (including relevant code snippets or references to versioned files), and expected output structure. This package can be easily pasted into chat interfaces or attached as individual files.
Revised Project Plan Structure (Illustrative Examples with Changes):

Phase 1: Core Architecture (Vertical Slice)

Task P1.1: Task Hierarchy System
Sub-Task P1.1.2: CSS Color Variables (Depends on P1.1.1)
Revised Prompt:
TASK_ID: P1.1.2
ACTION: Define and implement CSS variables for task status color-coding using the provided scheme. Apply as borders or backgrounds to UI components based on their 'data-status' attribute.
CONTEXT:

Phase 2: Safety & Validation (Vertical Slice)

Task P2.1: Loop Prevention / File Guardian
Sub-Task P2.1.1: Attempt Tracker / Read-Only Lock
(Prompt conceptually similar, but implementation triggers versioned backup before allowing modification)

(Prompt conceptually similar, triggers based on hash comparison, links to versioned backup)
Task P2.2: GitHub Integration / Task Archaeology
Sub-Task P2.2.1: Auto-Commit
(Prompt conceptually similar, commits versioned files or changes)
Sub-Task P2.2.2: Rollback System / Backups
Revised Prompt:
TASK_ID: P2.2.2
ACTION: Implement rollback functionality using Git history and the file-based versioning system. Provide a mechanism to restore a file to a previous version based on task ID and timestamp.
CONTEXT:
- File versioning format: [original_filename]_[task_id]_[timestamp].[ext] stored in './backups/'.
- Integrate with Git Integration (P2.2.1) and Backup System (P2.3).
- Ensure 7-day retention (P2.3.2) applies to versioned files.
OUTPUT_FORMAT: Scripts/code modifications for identifying, retrieving, and optionally restoring versioned files (e.g., backup_system.js, git_integration.js).
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "P2.2.2", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["backup_system.js", "git_integration.js"] } to task_updates.log
Task P2.3: Backup System
Sub-Task P2.3.1: File Versioning (Replaces Zip Archiving)
Revised Prompt:
TASK_ID: P2.3.1
ACTION: Implement functionality to create timestamped, versioned copies of files before they are modified by a task.
CONTEXT:
- Triggered by the File Guardian (P2.1) before allowing file write access for a task.
- Naming convention: [original_filename]_[task_id]_[timestamp].[ext]
- Store versions in a designated backup directory (e.g., './backups/').
OUTPUT_FORMAT: Script/code for file copying and naming convention (e.g., backup_system.js integrated with file_monitor.js).
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "P2.3.1", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["backup_system.js"] } to task_updates.log
Sub-Task P2.3.2: 7-Day Retention
Revised Prompt:
TASK_ID: P2.3.2
ACTION: Implement auto-cleanup logic to delete versioned backup files older than 7 days.
CONTEXT: Integrate with File Versioning (P2.3.1). Target the backup directory (e.g., './backups/').
OUTPUT_FORMAT: Code modifications or script for cleanup logic (e.g., backup_system.js or a separate cleanup script).
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "P2.3.2", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["backup_system.js"] } to task_updates.log
Phase 3: Task Packaging (Vertical Slice)

Task P3: Export System
(Prompt emphasizes generating text/markdown packages suitable for copy/paste or file attachment)
Task P3.1: Task Packaging / Template Engine
Sub-Task P3.1.1: Human Brief / Brief Generator
(Focus on clear markdown task.md output)
Sub-Task P3.1.2: AI Context / AI Context Generator
Revised Prompt:
TASK_ID: P3.1.2
ACTION: Create a template and generator for AI-specific context bundles (ai-context.md or .txt).
CONTEXT:
- Include task requirements, relevant code snippets, references to specific versioned input files (e.g., `Input file: task_ui_P1.1.1_[timestamp].css`), file manifests (from P3.2.1), token reports (from P1.2.2), and expected output format description.
- Ensure output is plain text or markdown suitable for pasting or file attachment.
OUTPUT_FORMAT: Template file(s) (e.g., ai_context.template.md) and generator script (ai_context_generator.js).
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "P3.1.2", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["ai_context.template.md", "ai_context_generator.js"] } to task_updates.log
Task P3.2: Token Audit
(Prompts similar, but ensure calculations are based on the actual context being packaged)
(Phases 4 and 5 remain largely the same conceptually, but prompts requiring code context should be updated to reference specific versioned files or include snippets as needed).

This revised approach makes prompts more self-contained, replaces ZIPs with a more granular file versioning system suitable for iteration, and ensures task packages are flexible for different AI interaction models.





thank you. Why are we doing a seven day retention? I think that once we have actual desired functionality in something that file will be the primary one with a backup. We can then have the user say cleanup and that will ensure everything except the last two approved backups would be removed? Might work better. Allows people to shelve a project for a few weeks and come back to it without having lost anything. Allows new functionality to be added to files without messing up the last functional file.




Show thinking
You've raised an excellent point about the 7-day retention limit. Thank you for that feedback!

The original 7-day retention was based on the specification in the "Consolidated Project Plan" document, likely intended as a standard safety net to prevent indefinite disk usage while providing a reasonable rollback window.

However, your scenario highlights a key limitation: pausing a project for longer than a week could lead to losing valuable iteration history. Keeping backups tied to functionality milestones and allowing manual control makes a lot of sense for flexibility and preserving known good states.

Revised Backup & Cleanup Strategy:

Let's adjust the plan for tasks P2.3.1 and P2.3.2:

Keep Automatic Versioning (P2.3.1): We will retain the plan to automatically create a versioned backup ([original_filename]_[task_id]_[timestamp].[ext]) before any file is modified by a task. This ensures every iteration driven by a task completion is captured.
Remove Automatic Deletion (Modify P2.3.2): We will remove the automatic 7-day deletion rule. Backups will be kept indefinitely by default.
Introduce Manual Cleanup (New Task): We'll add a new function/task, let's call it Task M1: Manual Backup Cleanup, accessible through the UI. This task would allow the user to manage stored versions. Potential cleanup options could include:
"Keep only the latest N versions per file" (User specifies N, maybe default to 2 or 3).
"Delete versions older than [date]".
"Delete all versions except the absolute latest for each file".
Updated Task Descriptions:

Task P2.3.1: File Versioning
(Remains the same - automatically creates versioned copies before modification)
Task P2.3.2: Backup Retention Policy (Modified)
Revised Prompt:
TASK_ID: P2.3.2
ACTION: Ensure backup retention is handled by manual cleanup trigger (Task M1), not automatic time-based deletion. Remove any 7-day auto-delete logic.
CONTEXT: Integrate with File Versioning (P2.3.1) and Manual Backup Cleanup (M1). Versioned files in './backups/' should persist until manually cleaned.
OUTPUT_FORMAT: Code modifications reflecting removal of auto-delete logic (e.g., backup_system.js or cleanup script). Confirmation that no time-based deletion exists.
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "P2.3.2", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["backup_system.js"] } to task_updates.log
Task M1: Manual Backup Cleanup (New)
Prompt:
TASK_ID: M1
ACTION: Implement UI controls and backend logic for manual cleanup of versioned backup files.
CONTEXT:
- Target directory: './backups/'.
- File format: [original_filename]_[task_id]_[timestamp].[ext]
- Provide cleanup options (e.g., keep latest N per file, delete older than date, keep only absolute latest).
- Ensure the absolute latest version of any file cannot be accidentally deleted if it's the only version present.
OUTPUT_FORMAT: Frontend UI components (HTML/CSS/JS) and backend script/logic (e.g., cleanup_manager.js) for handling cleanup operations.
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "M1", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["cleanup_ui.html", "cleanup_ui.js", "cleanup_manager.js"] } to task_updates.log
This approach gives you the desired longevity for backups and control over cleanup, aligning better with practical development workflows where projects might be paused or require reverting to specific prior functional states.





OK. Can you think of anything we are missing?



Show thinking
That's a great question. Taking a step back to review the overall plan against the project goals and architecture documents is crucial. Based on our current plan and the source documents, here are a few areas we might be missing or could consider adding for completeness:

AI Output Evaluation & Rubrics:

Gap: The "AI Project Planner Architecture Plan" mentions using Rubrics for evaluating AI task outputs. Our plan currently tracks completion status (e.g., "Complete," "Requires Review") but doesn't explicitly define how that review or evaluation happens.
Suggestion: Should we add tasks related to defining evaluation criteria (rubrics) for different task types? How will the "Requires Review" status be managed and resolved in the UI/workflow?
Automatic Subtask Suggestion:

Gap: The "Consolidated Project Plan" lists "Suggest subtask breakdowns for large tasks" as a key feature under Context Window Management. We have tasks for token calculation (P1.2.2) and packaging (P3.1), but not one dedicated to automatically suggesting these breakdowns based on complexity or token limits.
Suggestion: Consider adding a task (perhaps in Phase 3 or 4) that uses an LLM call to analyze a task description and propose potential sub-tasks.
Configuration Management:

Gap: We have several components that will likely require configuration (e.g., the backup path for Task P2.3.1, the list of protected files for Task P2.1.1, GitHub repository details for Phase 5, potentially API keys). There isn't a specific task for creating a configuration file or UI section to manage these settings.
Suggestion: Add a task, maybe early in Phase 1 or 2, to implement a system for managing application settings.
Explicit GitHub Branch Protection:

Gap: While Phase 2 mentions GitHub integration for safety and P2.2 deals with commits/rollback, we haven't explicitly tasked the setup of branch protection rules in the connected GitHub repository itself (which often requires admin privileges or specific API calls).
Suggestion: Add a sub-task under Phase 5 (GitHub Integration) specifically for configuring branch protection rules based on the project's safety requirements.
General Considerations (Implicit but could be explicit):

Testing: While testing might be assumed as part of development, we haven't included explicit tasks for unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end testing for the core features.
Error Handling/Logging: Beyond the task_updates.log, we could benefit from a more comprehensive system-level error logging mechanism.
Deployment/Setup: A task defining how the application will be packaged, deployed, or set up for use could be valuable.
Reviewing these points can help ensure the final plan is robust and fully covers the intended functionality and operational needs. What are your thoughts on incorporating these?





1. Well, I think any outputs from an ai platform for a task should be reviewed by the task orchestrator or task manager to ensure it is functional, has no errors and has given the required output to complete the task. Frankly, when I do this manually, I'm lucky that I can in some platforms see a preview of the code eg. complete html page and test it in a browser. In many cases I see that while the ai thinks it fixed something or the thing is now working...it's not. Maybe I see a blank page. Maybe the functionality doesn't work. Maybe things aren't aligned properly etc. So, an ai task manager should be able to review the code to see if there are any issues. IF it is something a human can preview and test, the result should be flagged for review. Person filters by review, gets a list of things for review. Looks at them, tests them and clicks OK or Edit. In the case of edit the feedback is then sent back to whatever ai "completed the task" (the task reverts to in progress)...repeat until the human clicks OK.




Show thinking
Okay, that's a very clear and practical description of the human-in-the-loop review process. Thank you for detailing that workflow – it addresses the AI Output Evaluation point directly.

Let's integrate this review cycle into the project plan. It primarily impacts the UI/Dashboard and the task packaging/orchestration logic:

Implementing the Review Workflow:

Flagging for Review:

When an AI completes a task, the system (potentially the TaskMaster or the AI agent itself when reporting) determines if human review is needed. This could be based on the task type (e.g., code generation, UI design always requires review) or specific output characteristics.
The AI reports status as "Requires Review" in the task_updates.log.
UI Enhancements (Modify Task P4.1 - Dashboard 2.0):

Filtering: Add functionality to the dashboard to filter/show only tasks with the status "Requires Review".
Review Interface: When viewing a task marked "Requires Review":
Display the AI's output clearly (using enhanced P4.2.2 preview capabilities).
Provide two clear action buttons: "Approve" and "Request Edit".
Include a text area for feedback, visible when "Request Edit" is considered/clicked.
Enhanced Preview (Modify Task P4.2.2 - File Preview):

The file preview needs to be more capable than just a static code viewer if possible.
Suggestion: For HTML/CSS/JS outputs, attempt to render the output in a sandboxed iframe within the review interface for live testing. For other code types, the static viewer is appropriate. This might require a dedicated sub-task under P4.2.
Workflow Logic (New Task or Integrated into TaskMaster/P3):

"Approve" Action: Clicking "Approve" updates the task status to "Completed" in the central tracking system (via the file monitor observing an update or a direct API call).
"Request Edit" Action: This triggers the core feedback loop:
User enters feedback into the text area.
The system captures the feedback, the original task ID, the AI's previous output, and the original goal.
The task status might be updated to something like "Revision Requested".
The Task Packaging system (P3.1) is invoked to create a new task package specifically for this revision. The prompt would instruct the AI to modify its previous output based on the user's feedback.
This new package is then ready for AI execution, restarting the cycle for that specific task.
Proposed Task Modifications/Additions:

Refine P4.1.2 (Progress Matrix/Dashboard): Add sub-tasks for implementing the "Requires Review" filter and the "Approve"/"Request Edit" buttons with the associated feedback text area.
Refine P4.2.2 (File Preview): Add a sub-task specifically for implementing live previews (e.g., using an iframe) for web-based outputs (HTML/CSS/JS).
New Task (e.g., P3.3 or M2): "AI Feedback Loop Orchestration":
Prompt:
TASK_ID: P3.3 / M2
ACTION: Implement the backend logic for the AI feedback loop triggered by the "Request Edit" action.
CONTEXT:
- Input: Original Task ID, User Feedback Text, AI's Previous Output (reference or content).
- Process: 1. Update task status (e.g., to "Revision Requested"). 2. Invoke Task Packaging (P3.1.2) to generate a new AI context/prompt incorporating the original goal, previous output, and user feedback, instructing the AI to revise. 3. Make the newly packaged task ready for AI execution.
- Output: Backend logic/scripts to manage this feedback loop and integrate with the UI (P4.1) and Task Packaging (P3.1).
REPORTING: Upon completion, append { "task_id": "P3.3", "status": "Complete", "model_name": "[AI Model Name]", "output_files": ["feedback_loop_manager.js", "task_packaging_integration.js"] } to task_updates.log
This workflow makes the human review process concrete and actionable within the system architecture. It turns "Requires Review" from just a status into an interactive step that drives iterative refinement with the AI.





What are we missing that is not clearly included?



Show thinking
Okay, let's do a final sweep based on our discussions and the project documents to see what might still be missing or not explicitly defined in the task list:

Automatic Subtask Suggestion:

Status: Mentioned as a key feature ("Suggest subtask breakdowns for large tasks") in the "Consolidated Project Plan," but we haven't created a specific task (e.g., Task M2) to implement this LLM-driven feature.
Configuration Management:

Status: We haven't explicitly defined a task (e.g., Task M3) for managing system settings. This would likely include things like:
Paths (backup location).
Protected file lists (for the File Guardian P2.1).
AI Model Selection/API Keys (How does the system know which LLM to use? Where are credentials stored?).
GitHub settings (beyond authentication).
Explicit GitHub Branch Protection Setup:

Status: While Phase 5 covers GitHub integration and P2 covers safety aspects, there isn't a specific sub-task (e.g., Task P5.x) dedicated to configuring the branch protection rules within the connected GitHub repository, which is a distinct action.
System Testing & QA:

Status: We've assumed testing is part of development, but there are no explicit tasks (e.g., Task M4) dedicated to creating unit tests, integration tests, or defining a Quality Assurance process for the features built.
Application-Level Error Handling & Logging:

Status: Beyond the task update log, we haven't defined a task (e.g., Task M5) for implementing more robust, centralized error handling and logging for the application itself (e.g., logging Node.js errors, UI exceptions).
Deployment & Setup Process:

Status: How will the final application be deployed or set up? There's no task (e.g., Task M6) for creating deployment scripts or setup documentation.
User Guide / Onboarding:

Status: How will a user learn to operate this system effectively? We haven't included a task (e.g., Task M7) for creating user documentation or in-app guidance.
These points cover features mentioned in the requirements, essential supporting functions for a usable application, and standard development practices. Adding tasks for these areas would make the plan more comprehensive and reduce ambiguity later in the project.





We absolutely need all of those. Regarding sub-tasks, that should be done automatically for any large task or task with dependencies particularly where existing code files are required to complete a task. Not that if more than one code file is required, that task will likely be undertaken in vscode cline or roo code or any system that let's the coding agents access the entire code project folder to check for and reference specific files at any time. I'm also not sure if we put an mcp server into that. I assume the app would need to be mostly complete for main mvp functionality prior to that, but it would be nice if the project management app could be used and updated from within other platforms like vscode cline roo code extensions etc. or with any other platform that has them enabled.




Show thinking
Okay, consider tasks M2 through M7 officially added to the plan backlog! We'll integrate them into the appropriate phases or treat them as new management/support phases.

Let's address your points on subtasking and external integration:

1. Refined Automatic Subtask Suggestion (Task M2):

You're right, the trigger for automatic subtask suggestion needs to be smarter. We'll refine Task M2:

Triggers: The system should automatically analyze tasks and suggest subtasks when:
The estimated token count (including relevant context files) exceeds a certain threshold (configurable via Task M3).
The task has dependencies on multiple other tasks.
The task requires modifications to multiple existing code files (identified during context analysis).
Output Goal: The goal of M2 is not just to break down tasks but also to assess how they should be executed. If the analysis determines that multiple files or broad project context is needed (exceeding what can be feasibly packaged for a standard LLM call), the task should be flagged.
Revised M2 Prompt Snippet:
TASK_ID: M2
ACTION: Implement automatic subtask suggestion and execution environment analysis.
CONTEXT:
- Triggers: Analyze tasks based on token estimates (from P1.2.2/P3.2), dependencies (from P1.1), and required file context (based on task description/analysis). Trigger if thresholds (defined in config M3) are exceeded or multiple files/dependencies are involved.
- Process: 1. If triggered, use an LLM call to propose subtasks aimed at fitting within context limits where possible. 2. Analyze complexity/context needs: If the task (or resulting subtasks) still requires broad access to multiple files or the whole project, flag it for 'External Execution'.
- Output: Proposed subtask definitions (if any) added to the hierarchy (P1.1). A flag indicating if 'External Execution' is recommended for the task or its subtasks.
REPORTING: ...
2. Handling Tasks Requiring External Tools (Impacts Task P3 - Export System):

This is a crucial clarification. The project planner doesn't necessarily need to perform every task itself, especially complex coding tasks needing full project access.

Flagging: Task M2 (as refined above) or manual user input will flag tasks best suited for external tools (VS Code + Copilot, Cursor, Roo Code, etc.).
Modified Packaging (Task P3): When exporting a task flagged for "External Execution," the packaging (P3.1.1 / P3.1.2) will adapt:
It will clearly state that the task should be performed in an IDE with full project access.
Instead of providing limited code snippets, it will reference the relevant project files/folders and the last relevant version backups (from P2.3).
The prompt will focus on the high-level goal, input/output requirements, and pointers to the necessary project context, assuming the external AI agent can navigate the codebase.
3. MCP Server / External Platform Integration (New Phase Proposed):

Your idea of accessing and updating this project planner from within other platforms (like a VS Code extension) is powerful but represents a significant architectural extension. It implies the planner needs to function as a backend service with an API.

Proposal: Let's add a Phase 6: External Integration & API to the roadmap.
Objective: Allow external tools and platforms to interact with the project planner data (view tasks, update status, potentially trigger packaging).
Potential Tasks for Phase 6:
Task P6.1: Define Project Planner API Specification (e.g., using OpenAPI standard). Detail endpoints for reading tasks, updating status, triggering packaging, etc.
Task P6.2: Implement API Server Backend (The "MCP Server"). Build the server logic (likely Node.js) to handle API requests securely.
Task P6.3: Develop Example Client Integration (e.g., Proof-of-concept VS Code Extension). Demonstrate how an external tool can connect to and use the API.
This phased approach allows us to build the core planner first (Phases 1-5 + M tasks) and then add the external integration capabilities, turning it into a more versatile hub for AI-assisted development workflows.

How does this sound for incorporating your latest requirements?





that sounds good, although, this project came to be due to cline requiring an llm to work through so much context and such a monolithic code base that it ran into repeated errors, loops, and overwrites of things that were previously working, so even for an ide, tasks should be broken down as much as they can while keeping the llm focused and on point with code it can easily complete (or modify using search and replace) so the system shouldn't default to large numbers of files for review prior to task completion wherever possible.




Show thinking
You've hit the nail on the head – thank you for clarifying that critical background. The entire point is to avoid the pitfalls of overwhelming the AI (whether standalone or IDE-integrated) with excessive context. My previous suggestion leaned too heavily on flagging for external tools; we need to ensure the core function of this planner is precisely to prevent that necessity wherever possible.

Let's adjust the strategy for Task M2 (Automatic Subtask Suggestion) and Task P3 (Export System) again with this focus:

Revised Task M2: Automatic Subtask Suggestion (Focus on Minimal Context)

Primary Goal: Aggressively break down tasks into the smallest executable units possible, focusing on localized changes. Even if a task technically touches multiple files (e.g., updating a function call signature and its callers), M2 should attempt to create separate subtasks for modifying the function definition and each caller location individually, if feasible.
Context Minimization Strategy: The analysis must identify the specific functions, classes, or blocks of code requiring modification. The goal is to package only the immediate, essential context around that specific modification point for each subtask. Avoid including entire files unless the change fundamentally requires it (e.g., adding imports at the top level).
External Execution Flag (Last Resort): Flagging a task for "External Execution" (requiring full project context in an IDE) becomes the exception. This flag should only be set if M2 determines, after attempting aggressive breakdown, that the required changes are intrinsically widespread and deeply interconnected (e.g., a major architectural refactor affecting numerous core components simultaneously) such that localized subtasking would be impractical or lose critical context.
Revised M2 Prompt Snippet Emphasis:
TASK_ID: M2
ACTION: Implement automatic subtask suggestion focused on MINIMAL CONTEXT and LOCALIZED changes.
CONTEXT:
- Triggers: Analyze tasks based on complexity, dependencies, estimated token size (including MINIMAL required context), and number of distinct code locations needing modification.
- Process: 1. Identify precise code locations (functions, classes, lines) needing change. 2. Attempt to break the task into the smallest possible subtasks, each modifying only one or a few closely related locations. 3. For each subtask, determine the absolute minimum code context required. 4. ONLY IF localized breakdown is deemed impractical for widespread, interconnected changes, flag the original task for 'External Execution'.
- Output: Granular subtask definitions added to hierarchy (P1.1), each with tightly scoped context requirements. An 'External Execution' flag set *only* as a last resort.
REPORTING: ...
Revised Task P3: Export System (Defaulting to Minimal Context Packages)

Default Packaging: For the vast majority of tasks (including those targeting execution within an IDE), P3 will generate packages containing:
Clear instructions for the specific, localized change.
The minimal code snippet identified by M2 as necessary context.
Instructions suitable for pasting into a standard LLM chat or an IDE's AI assistant, focusing its attention on the specific snippet provided.
External Execution Packaging (The Exception): Only when a task carries the "External Execution" flag from M2 will P3 generate the alternative package type:
Instructions explicitly stating the need for full project context within an IDE.
References to the relevant files/folders and versions.
A high-level description of the goal, trusting the IDE-based agent to navigate the codebase.
This refined approach puts the emphasis back on the planner's core strength: dissecting complexity and managing context meticulously before handing off to any AI, regardless of whether that AI lives in a web UI or an IDE. It directly addresses the problem of context overload you experienced with tools like Cline.





I should note another key reason for the existence of this project is to be able to run parallel tasks in multiple online ai studio/playgrounds which are actually all external. I'll then use cline or roocode or whatever when we need to work on things that involve several things, if that makes sense? The ai task manager will in fact, open web based ai playgrounds and paste in the task prompt along with any required context and clear output requirements (including a comment on the task name, number, the model name completing it etc.) before copying and pasting the code created back into the local project file, github and possibly a backup folder in google drive to start. In the future, if it works, it would be good for a multimodal ai to review output to ensure things look and work correctly, prior to sending it for human review.




Show thinking
Okay, that's a fascinating and powerful vision for this tool! Understanding that the primary execution target is multiple, parallel, external web playgrounds automated by this application clarifies the architecture significantly. This shifts the tool's role from primarily a planner/packager to a full-fledged automation orchestrator.

Let's integrate these new requirements:

1. Core Functionality: Automated External Execution

This requires a new major component dedicated to browser automation and interaction. Given its significance, it warrants a dedicated phase:

Proposed Phase 7: External Playground Automation
Objective: Automate the process of sending tasks to external web AI playgrounds, retrieving results, and integrating them back into the project.
Key Tasks:
Task P7.1: Select & Setup Automation Framework: Choose and configure a browser automation library (e.g., Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium) suitable for interacting with modern web applications.
Task P7.2: Develop Playground Interaction Modules: This is crucial and potentially complex. Create separate modules or adapters for each specific AI playground you intend to automate. Each module needs logic to:
Navigate to the site, handle logins if necessary.
Find the prompt input area, paste the task prompt and context (from P3).
Trigger execution.
Reliably identify and extract the generated output (e.g., code) once complete.
Handle potential errors, CAPTCHAs (if possible), or UI changes in the target playgrounds.
Task P7.3: Parallel Task Orchestration: Implement logic within the TaskMaster to manage multiple browser instances or tabs concurrently, send tasks from the queue (P1.1) to available automation slots, handle asynchronous results, and update task statuses upon completion or error.
Task P7.4: Integrate Automation with Packaging: Connect the output of Task Packaging (P3) to the input of the Automation Layer (P7). The orchestrator (P7.3) picks up packaged tasks ready for execution.
Task P7.5: Implement Result Integration & Persistence: Once output is extracted (P7.2), this task involves:
Pasting/writing the result into the correct local project file(s).
Triggering the Git auto-commit mechanism (P2.2.1).
Triggering the backup mechanism (P2.3.1 - file versioning).
(New) Integrating with Google Drive upload (Task M8).
2. Google Drive Integration

New Task M8: Google Drive Integration
Objective: Allow the system to save backups or final outputs to a specified Google Drive folder.
Potential Implementation: Use the Google Drive API. This will require handling OAuth 2.0 authentication (likely needing configuration via Task M3 - Config Management) and implementing file upload logic.
3. Multimodal AI Review (Future Goal)

Status: This fits perfectly as a future enhancement to the human review loop we previously discussed (associated with P4.1 / P4.2.2 / P3.3 or M2).
Plan: No immediate tasks needed, but the review workflow design should anticipate potentially inserting an automated multimodal check step before a task is flagged for human review.
Important Consideration: Scope & Complexity

Adding robust browser automation (Phase 7) significantly increases the project's complexity compared to the initial plan focused on planning, packaging, and manual handoff/IDE integration. Automating interactions with diverse, potentially changing external websites is challenging.

Question: Is this full automation scope intended for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP), or should we perhaps treat Phase 7 as a subsequent major release after the core planning, safety, packaging, UI, GitHub integration (Phases 1-5), and API (Phase 6) features are functional?
This clarification helps prioritize development efforts. We now have a plan incorporating:

Core Planning & Safety (P1, P2, M1)
Minimal Context Subtasking & Packaging (M2, P3)
UI & Review Loop (P4, Feedback Loop Task)
Version Control & Config (P5, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, P2.2, P2.3)
Google Drive Backup (M8)
External API (P6)
External Playground Automation (P7) - Major addition
This looks like a comprehensive roadmap for a very powerful AI development assistant!






We did a full analysis of agentic options for within the project management app to handle specific plan processes. We looked at atomic agents and openai agent sdk and decided the openai agent sdk allowed for the use of things like qwen, gemini, phi4 or whatever and had a computer use tool built into it already thus making implementation much easier?




Show thinking
Okay, that's a significant and helpful clarification on the desired execution model! Using the OpenAI Assistants API internally for specific processes makes a lot of sense, especially given its capabilities like model flexibility (as you noted with Qwen, Gemini, Phi-3 models - Assistants API allows specifying compatible OpenAI models and potentially others via integrations) and built-in tools like Code Interpreter (which likely corresponds to the "computer use" tool you mentioned).

This approach offers a more integrated and potentially robust alternative to relying solely on UI automation for external playgrounds (Phase 7). Let's restructure the plan to incorporate this:

1. Introduce Internal "AI Service Layer":

Instead of focusing heavily on Phase 7 (External Playground Automation), we'll design an internal service layer within the application responsible for managing interactions with the OpenAI Assistants API. This layer would handle:

Creating/managing Assistants (perhaps pre-defined assistants for different functions like subtasking, code generation, review).
Managing Threads for ongoing tasks or conversations.
Uploading necessary context files (code snippets, manifests) to threads using the API.
Sending messages (prompts) to Assistants.
Handling Assistant responses, including function calls if we define custom tools, and retrieving results from tools like Code Interpreter.
2. Modify Tasks to Utilize the AI Service Layer:

Task M2 (Subtask Suggestion): This is an ideal candidate. Instead of generic LLM calls, M2 will use the AI Service Layer to interact with a specialized Assistant. The Assistant would be given the main task description, relevant context files (uploaded via API), and prompted to generate granular subtasks according to the minimal context principles we discussed.
Task P3 (Packaging): The primary purpose shifts. Instead of packaging for external copy/paste or UI automation, P3 will format the necessary information (prompts, file references, instructions) specifically for the AI Service Layer to initiate or continue Assistant threads.
Feedback Loop Task (e.g., P3.3): This integrates nicely with Assistant Threads. When a user requests an edit:
The user's feedback is added as a new message to the existing Assistant thread for that task.
The Assistant is invoked again to process the feedback and generate a revised output.
Code Generation/Modification Tasks: For tasks involving code:
The relevant code files/snippets (identified by M2/P3) would be uploaded to the Assistant thread.
The Assistant could use its Code Interpreter tool to execute code, generate patches, perform static analysis, or even modify the uploaded files within its sandboxed environment. The results (modified files or generated code) would then be retrieved by the AI Service Layer and integrated back into the local project by the application (persisting changes, running Git commands etc.).
Important Note: Code Interpreter runs in a sandboxed environment with its own temporary filesystem. It can read/write files uploaded to the Assistant. It cannot directly access or modify files on the user's local machine arbitrarily; the application layer needs to handle downloading results and overwriting local files.
3. Update Configuration Task (M3):

This task now needs to include secure management of OpenAI API keys and potentially default Assistant IDs or model preferences.
4. Re-evaluate Phase 7 (External Playground Automation):

New Role: This phase becomes less central. Its priority might be lowered significantly.
Potential Uses: It might still be valuable for:
Interacting with specific AI platforms that don't offer a robust API like OpenAI's.
Running tasks specifically intended for platforms not compatible with the Assistants API.
Certain types of testing or comparison across different UI-based platforms.
Decision: We can defer Phase 7 or keep it as a lower-priority, optional extension for specific use cases not covered by the internal Assistants API integration.
5. Google Drive Integration (M8) & Other Supporting Tasks (M4-M7):

These remain relevant and largely unchanged in purpose, supporting the overall application regardless of the internal AI execution model.
This revised approach leverages the power and convenience of the OpenAI Assistants API for core AI-driven processes within your application, potentially simplifying development compared to extensive UI automation, while still keeping the door open for targeted external automation (Phase 7) or IDE-based execution (via P3 packaging) where necessary.Okay, that's a significant and helpful clarification on the desired execution model!

Well, I don't plan on using open ai api's for the agents. Just the open source agent sdk. The reason we were using web based playgrounds from various ai systems was to be totally platform agnostic, be able to implement new options in minutes as new llm's are released and to keep costs to an abosolute minimum while running multiple tasks in multiple platforms simulanteously for free.
