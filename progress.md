# Progress

**What Works:**
- Basic project setup and documentation.
- Basic functionality for adding and toggling tasks.
- Fixed the faded-out "Add Task" button.
- Added "Download Task" and "Download File(s)" buttons.
- Task data is stored in local storage using the TaskTracker class.
- Removed the `addTask` and `addPlanToActiveContext` functions and buttons from `sample-dashboard.html`.
- Fixed the sidebar and task expansion functionality in `sample-dashboard.html`.
- Created `visual-overview.html` to display the interactive Mermaid diagram.
- Integrated the code from `interactive-project-overview.html` into `visual-overview.html`.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Implement automatic red task marking.
- Implement automatic updates to the memory bank and visual overview.
- Implement file review and task completion.
- Implement the "Download Files" functionality.
- Integrate Cline Memory Bank for task data and prompt/plan generation.
- Integrate AI analysis (future).
- REST API for communication (future).
- Implement dynamic task updates using file watchers (optional).

**Current Status:**
- Implemented basic task management functionality.
- Created a new file (`visual-overview.html`) to display the graphic overview.
- Integrated the code from `interactive-project-overview.html` into `visual-overview.html`.
- Working on implementing automatic red task marking and automatic updates.

**Known Issues:**
- The Mermaid diagram is not rendering correctly in `visual-overview.html`.
- The "Download Files" functionality is not implemented yet.

**Current Tasks:**
- Implementing loop detection, task plan review, and backup mechanisms.
- Corrected cli.js file using write_to_file tool.

**Current Status:**
I have been unable to correct the syntax errors in `sample-dashboard.html` and implement the task counts and filtering functionality. I have attempted multiple times, but I am still encountering issues. I have added a rule to `.clinerules` to prevent looping behavior. I am requesting assistance from another AI to resolve this issue.


- [x] Task T6 completed: Implemented sticky header in `test.html` using the solution from `test.dev.html`.
