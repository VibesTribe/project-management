1. Define Core Features
Your app should automate tasks like:

Task Assignment : AI assigns tasks to platforms (e.g., DeepSeek, Gemini) 
.
Progress Tracking : Monitor task status (pending/completed) 
.
Market Research : Generate reports using AI (competitors, pricing, features) 
.
AI Code Generation : Use tools like GitHub Copilot to build modules 
.
2. Choose AI Tools for Development
Leverage no-code/low-code AI platforms to build the app:

AI Coding Assistants :
GitHub Copilot : Generates code for React/TypeScript components 
.
Cursor : AI-first IDE for debugging and code suggestions 
.
Project Management AI Tools :
Easy Redmine : Automates scheduling and reporting 
.
ClickUp + AI : Drafts tasks and predicts deadlines 
.
3. Modular Architecture
Break the app into vertical slices (aligned with AI capabilities):

Brainstorming Module :
Use Gemini or Qwen for idea refinement 
.
Market Research Module :
Deploy Hugging Face’s transformers for competitor analysis 
.
Task Execution Module :
Use n8n workflows to assign tasks to AI platforms 
.
4. Automate with AI
Task Automation :
Use DeepSeek for code generation and Gemini for vision tasks (e.g., UI validation) 
.
Reporting :
Auto-generate status reports using AI summarization tools 
.
5. Validate AI Outputs
Code Quality :
Use GitHub Copilot’s suggestions to fix errors 
.
Validate AI-generated code with tools like ESLint 
.
Task Accuracy :
Re-run failed tasks up to 3 times; switch platforms if errors persist 
.
6. Deployment & Iteration
Hosting : Use free tiers (e.g., Google Compute Engine, Vercel) 
.
Feedback Loop :
Let users flag issues; use AI to refine outputs iteratively 
.
Example Workflow
User Input : Describe an app idea in a chat interface.
AI Brainstorming : Gemini refines the idea 
.
Market Research : Hugging Face generates a competitor report 
.
Task Assignment : n8n sends coding tasks to DeepSeek 
.
Code Validation : GitHub Copilot reviews outputs 
.
Deployment : Host on Vercel and notify the user 
.
Final Answer
{AI Coding Assistants (Copilot/Cursor) + No-Code Tools (n8n/Easy Redmine) + Modular Vertical Slices}

Use AI coders to generate React/TypeScript code 
.
Automate workflows with n8n and Hugging Face 
.
Validate outputs with ESLint and iterative feedback loops 
.
This approach lets you build a full-featured app without writing code , leveraging AI for development, task management, and quality assurance 
.To build your AI-driven project management app with a vertical slice architecture , where the AI itself helps construct the app, follow this structured plan:

1. Core AI Task Manager Design
The AI task manager will act as the "brain" of the app, automating workflows and ensuring modular development. Key features include:

Role-Based AI Agents :
Brainstorming Agent : Refines app ideas using Gemini or Qwen 
.
Research Agent : Generates market reports via Hugging Face or DeepSeek 
.
Planning Agent : Creates vertical slice plans (e.g., "User Auth Slice") using Mermaid.js 
.
Execution Agent : Assigns tasks to AI platforms (e.g., code generation with GitHub Copilot) 
.
Dynamic API Integration :
Store API keys/endpoints in a JSON file (e.g., apis.json) for platforms like DeepSeek, Gemini, and Hugging Face 
.
Allow users to add new platforms via the UI.
2. Vertical Slice Architecture for the App
Break the app into self-contained vertical slices , each representing a feature (e.g., "Task Assignment," "Market Research"). Each slice includes:

UI Components (React/TypeScript).
Business Logic (e.g., API calls to AI platforms).
Data Layer (e.g., GitHub/GitLab integration for code storage).
Example Slice :

Task Assignment Slice
UI: Task Input Form
Logic: Assign to DeepSeek
Data: Save to GitHub

3. Self-Building Workflow
The AI will use its own functionality to construct the app:

Auto-Generate Project Plan :
Use the Planning Agent to create a vertical slice roadmap 
.
Example prompt:
text
Copy
1
2
"Generate a vertical slice plan for an AI-driven project management app.  
Include slices for brainstorming, market research, task execution, and GitHub integration."  
AI-Coded Modules :
Use GitHub Copilot to generate React/TypeScript code for each slice 
.
Validate code with ESLint and auto-tests (e.g., Jest) 
.
Integration with VS Code Cline :
Use n8n workflows to sync tasks between the app and VS Code Cline 
.
Example:
Task created in the app → n8n triggers AI code generation → Output saved to GitHub → Status updated in Cline.
4. Avoiding Proprietary Tools
Open-Source Alternatives :
Use Tillywork 
 for CRM/project modules.
Deploy Ollama for self-hosted AI models (e.g., Qwen, Llama3) 
.
Free-Tier Hosting :
Host on Google Compute Engine (free tier) or Vercel 
.
5. React/TypeScript Code Generation
AI Prompts for Consistency :
Example prompt for the Brainstorming Slice:
text
Copy
1
2
3
"Generate a React/TypeScript component for brainstorming ideas.  
Include a chat interface with Gemini API integration.  
Use Material-UI for styling."  
Validation :
Use GitHub Copilot’s suggestions to fix errors 
.
6. Handling React Bias
Code Validation :
Use ESLint rules to enforce React/TypeScript best practices 
.
Example:

Supports structured workflows but does not natively integrate market research or brainstorming.
Asana 
:
Widely used for team and client project management but has limited AI capabilities (e.g., basic automation).
Requires manual setup for vertical slice task assignments.
2. Vertical Slice Architecture Support
ASP.NET Vertical Slice Template 
:
A development framework for structuring projects into vertical slices (UI to data store).
Not a project management app but a coding template, requiring customization for PM workflows.
LinkedIn’s Approach 
:
Advocates for organizing projects into vertical slices but focuses on software architecture, not task management.
3. Challenges with Existing Tools
Complexity and Integration 
:
Tools like Trello or Evernote are powerful but often too generic, leading to adoption difficulties.
None explicitly address AI-driven brainstorming, market research, or React bias mitigation.
Market Research Automation :
No tool in the knowledge base automates market research reports (e.g., competitor analysis, pricing strategies).
4. Gaps in Current Solutions
AI Brainstorming & Market Research :
Tools like Forecast 
 and Confluence 
 lack built-in AI for idea refinement or market analysis.
React Bias Mitigation :
No existing tool addresses framework bias in AI-generated code (e.g., Vue.js vs. React).
Multi-AI Task Orchestration :
No solution dynamically assigns tasks to external AI platforms (e.g., DeepSeek, Gemini) based on cost/capability.
Final Answer
Partial Solutions Exist, But Not Holistic :

Forecast 
 and Confluence 
 handle AI-driven task management but lack brainstorming, market research, and vertical slice planning.
ASP.NET templates 
 support vertical slices architecturally but not in project management workflows.
Custom Development Required : Your outlined system (modular vertical slices, multi-AI orchestration, React bias mitigation) likely requires building a bespoke solution using tools like n8n (workflow automation), Hugging Face (AI models), and Mermaid.js (visualization).

To construct your AI-driven project management app with modular roles, API flexibility, and vertical slice architecture, follow this structured approach:

1. System Prompts for AI Roles
Define specific system prompts for each AI role to ensure focused behavior. Use the principles from 
, 
, 
 to craft clear instructions and examples.

Example System Prompts
Brainstorming AI :
text
Copy
1
"You are a creative assistant specializing in app ideation. Use open-ended questions to refine the user's idea. Prioritize clarity and innovation. Avoid technical jargon. Example: 'What problem does your app solve?'"
Source: 
 (specificity), 
 (examples).
Research AI :
text
Copy
1
"Analyze competitors, pricing, and user feedback. Output structured reports (brief/medium/comprehensive). Use bullet points and actionable insights. Example: 'Competitor X lacks feature Y, creating an opportunity for your app.'"
Source: 
 (evaluation), 
 (role prompting).
Planning AI :
text
Copy
1
"Create a vertical slice architecture. Prioritize foundational tasks (e.g., project setup) and identify independent/dependent tasks. Use Mermaid.js syntax for visualization. Example: 'graph TD; A[Setup] --> B[UI Design]; B --> C[API Integration]'."
Source: 
 (agentic systems), 
 (role prompting).
Task Manager AI :
text
Copy
1
"Assign tasks to platforms (DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.) based on cost and capability. Validate outputs against task descriptions. Retry failed tasks up to 3 times. Example: 'Task assigned to Gemini for vision analysis. Status: Pending.'"
Source: 
 (self-awareness), 
 (prompt generator).
2. API Integration & Flexibility
Dynamic API Configuration :
Store API endpoints and credentials in a JSON file or database (e.g., apis.json).
Example entry:
json
Copy

{
  "DeepSeek": {
    "url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
    "key": "YOUR_KEY",
    "capabilities": ["text", "function_calling"]
  },
  "Gemini": {
    "url": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1",
    "key": "YOUR_KEY",
    "capabilities": ["vision", "text"]
  }
}
Allow users to add new APIs via the UI (no code changes required).
Fallback Mechanism :
If an API fails repeatedly, switch to a backup (e.g., Hugging Face’s free inference API) 
.
3. Vertical Slice Architecture
Modular Task Execution :
Foundational Tasks : Setup, authentication, core APIs 
.
Independent Tasks : UI design, logo creation (parallelizable).
Dependent Tasks : API integration (requires foundational tasks to complete first).
Visualization :
Use Mermaid.js to display task dependencies and progress in real time 
.
5. MCP Server & VS Code Integration
n8n Workflows :
Use n8n to sync tasks between your app and VS Code’s Cline extension.
Example workflow:
Task created in the app → n8n webhook triggers.
n8n assigns the task to an AI platform (via API).
Output saved to GitHub/local folder → status updated in the app.
VS Code Cline :
Pull tasks directly into the editor and push completed outputs to the app.

{Open Deep Search (ODS) for Market Research + Hybrid Deployment}

ODS Use Case :
Use ODS exclusively for market research reports (e.g., analyzing competitors, pricing, user feedback) 
.
Example workflow:
User inputs an app idea.
ODS generates a report using web search and reasoning 
.
Report feeds into the AI planner for task prioritization.
Google Compute Engine (GCE) Free Tier :
Feasible for lightweight tasks :
Run ODS with smaller models (e.g., Qwen-1.5) on the free tier’s 1 GB RAM and 5 GB storage 
.
Use Hugging Face Inference API for compute-heavy tasks (e.g., LLM inference) 
.
Limitations :
Avoid large models (e.g., Llama3-70B) due to RAM constraints.
Cost-Effective Alternatives :
Gemini’s Deep Research :
Free tier available for basic reports 
.
Hybrid Setup :
Combine ODS (for reasoning) with Scrapy Cloud (for web scraping) and Google Sheets (for data storage) 
.
Example Workflow
Market Research Phase :
ODS generates a report on competitors and user needs 
.
Task Planning Phase :
AI planner uses the report to create a vertical slice architecture 
.
Validation :
Use Mermaid.js to visualize dependencies and ensure alignment with research insights 
.
Key Sources :

 Gemini’s Deep Research for automated reports.
 ODS as a Perplexity alternative.
 GCE free tier constraints.
 Market research tools for hybrid workflows.
This setup balances ODS’s capabilities with free-tier limitations, ensuring cost efficiency and actionable insights.
